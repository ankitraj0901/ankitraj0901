## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Ankit Raj**, a **Software Engineer at Accenture** and an **MCA student at PES University, Bengaluru**.

I enjoy working on **real-world problems** that involve:
- clean backend architecture
- meaningful frontend experiences
- intelligent systems using **Machine Learning**
- and learning how things work **under the hood**

I strongly believe in **fundamentals, system design, and trade-offs**, not just tools.
